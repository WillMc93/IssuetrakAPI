# Issuetrak API
## Description

This Python library defines the IssuetrakAPI class for intereacting with the Issuetrak API.

## Dependencies

This script uses only standard Python libraries.

## Use

This script will need to be placed into a directory with the script that calls it and an API key in a file called "key.api." This just needs to be the API key copied and pasted into a plain text file (should end with an "=").

## Notes
* This library was adapted from Issuetrak's official API documentation samples available here: https://helpcenter.issuetrak.com/home/2324-api-samples-overview
* More documentation soon hopefully.
